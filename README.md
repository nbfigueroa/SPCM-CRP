This repo provides code for running for Non-parametric Spectral Clustering algorithm on Covariance Matrix Datasets (SPCM-CRP) introduced in [1]. In a nutshell **SPCM-CRP** is a similarity-dependent Chinese Restaurant process. Where the similarity matrix comes from the Spectral Polytope Covariance Matrix Similarity function and the non-parametric clustering is applied on the spectral manifold of the similarity function.
