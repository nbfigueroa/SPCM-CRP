# SPCM-CRP
Code for Non-parametric Spectral Clustering algorithm on Covariance Matrix Space (SPCM-CRP) introduced in [1]. 
In a nutshell it is a similarity-dependent Chinese Restaurant process. Where the similarity matrix comes from the Spectral Polytope Covariance Matrix Similarity function and the non-parametric clustering is applied on the spectral manifold of the similarity function.
