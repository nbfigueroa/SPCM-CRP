This repo provides code for running for Non-parametric Spectral Clustering algorithm on Covariance Matrix Datasets (SPCM-CRP) introduced in [1]. In a nutshell, **SPCM-CRP** is a similarity-dependent Chinese Restaurant process. Where the similarity matrix comes from the Spectral Polytope Covariance Matrix Similarity function and the non-parametric clustering is applied on the spectral manifold of the similarity function.

### Dependencies
Download the following toolbox and make sure to have it in your MATLAB path:
- [ML_toolbox](): Machine learning toolbox containing a plethora of clustering, classification and regression algorithms accompanying the [Advanced Machine Learning]() course imparted at EPFL by the Author and Prof. Aude Billard.
