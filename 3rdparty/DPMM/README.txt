This is a matlab library for Gaussian Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DPMMs).
It includes both variational and Monte Carlo inference.

To test / see how this program works, run demodpmm.m in matlab

This code was mostly written in 2007. When I found out it was
referenced in a paper in 2012, I made a few cosmetic changes and put
it on Github. It's not guaranteed to work perfectly. You should
check it before using it for anything really important.

Some of the sampling code is built on top of software by Michael
Mandel, which was also released under GPL.
