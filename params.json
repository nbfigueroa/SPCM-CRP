In a nutshell, **SPCM-CRP** is a similarity-dependent Chinese Restaurant process. Where the similarity matrix comes from the Spectral Polytope Covariance Matrix Similarity function and the non-parametric clustering is applied on the spectral manifold of the similarity function.\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\nDownload the following toolboxes and make sure to have them in your MATLAB path:\r\n- [ML_toolbox](): Machine learning toolbox containing a plethora of clustering, classification and regression algorithms accompanying the [Advanced Machine Learning]() course imparted at EPFL by the Author and Prof. Aude Billard.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Run Demo\r\n\r\n\r\n### Publication\r\n[1] Nadia Figueroa and Aude Billard, \"Transform Invariant Discovery of Dynamical Primitives: Leveraging Spectral and Bayesian Non-parametric Methods.\" In preparation for Pattern Recognition.\r\n",
