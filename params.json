Where the similarity matrix comes from the Spectral Polytope Covariance Matrix Similarity function and the non-parametric clustering is applied on the spectral manifold of the similarity function.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Transform Invariant Discovery of Dynamical Primitives: Leveraging Spectral and Bayesian Non-parametric Methods.
