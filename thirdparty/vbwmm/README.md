# Variational Bayes Wishart Mixture Model
The repository contains MATLAB code for the VB-WMM model. The model aims to cluster a set of Gram matrices originating from zero-mean Gaussian data. Coordinate ascent variational inference is used, and due to the chosen priors and Q-distribution all updates are closed form achieved by moment matching. 

Please see the following publication for further details on the model and its application to dynamic functional brain connecitivity,
